# Purpose: Analyzes simulation results statistically

# Import necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, scipy.stats)
# Load the results from the CSV file

# Define a function calculate_statistics:
#    - Computes mean, median, standard deviation, min/max, and winning probability
#    - Returns a dictionary with summary statistics

# Define a function hypothesis_testing:
#    - Tests if the final balances follow a normal distribution
#    - Uses Shapiro-Wilk test or Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
#    - Outputs the statistical significance of results

# Define a function analyze_ruin_probability:
#    - Computes how often the player went bankrupt (balance â‰¤ 0)
#    - Returns the probability of ruin

# Save the results into a summary text file
